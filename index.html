                I'm a sophmore at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I'm majoring in computer science. For fun I like 
                to play video games, watch videos, and run. I'm also on my college's robotics team. I also made 
                varisty on my cross country team back in high school. The reason I like computer science is that it was the first
                thing in high school that I both thoroughly enjoy and I was good at it. In fact I finish my AP Computer Science
                class 3 months ahead of schedule.

                I also enjoy skiing because I am quite good at it. In addiation I'm also a very lucky skier the amount of times
                I could ave been seriously hurt are more numerous than I like to admit. My favorite game is Persona 5 Royal it was
                really fun and it honestly had a major impact on my character.
